# Cylindrical Gear Reducer - CATIA Model

## Project Overview
This project involves the **design and modeling of a single-stage cylindrical gear reducer** using CATIA. It covers all essential subassemblies, including **shafts, gears, housing, and auxiliary components** (breather plug, oil level sight glass). The project also includes technical documentation, such as **calculations, memos, assembly drawings, and execution drawings**.

## Features
- **3D Modeling in CATIA**: Components and subassemblies were designed with a focus on mechanical functionality and manufacturability.
- **Structural and Kinematic Analysis**: Verifications of **shafts, bearings, and gears** were performed.
- **Technical Calculations**: Gear meshing, forces, and stresses were analyzed to ensure structural integrity.
- **Final Documentation**: Includes detailed **assembly drawings and execution drawings**.
